# RABIN KARP ALGORITHM

**ALGORITHM WORKING**

1. In this algorithm we first make the function hashvalue which generate the hash value of patter that we have to search.
2. After that we find the hash value of pattern.size() from the main string and compare the hash value if the hash value is equal then we check for the pattern.
3. If the hash value is not equal then we move the pointer to next index and find the hash of new string's pattern.
